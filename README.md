FINTRACK PRO – CLI FINANCE MANAGER
Project Documentation

1. Introduction
FinTrack Pro is a command line based personal finance management system developed using Python, SQLite and SQLAlchemy ORM. 
The project helps users to manage daily expenses, track subscriptions, search records, maintain monthly budgets and generate analytics using raw SQL queries.

2. Objectives
• To understand ORM based database interaction  
• To use SQLite with Python  
• To implement CRUD operations  
• To write raw SQL for analytics  
• To design modular architecture  
• To build interview oriented project

3. Technologies Used
• Python  
• SQLite Database  
• SQLAlchemy ORM  
• Raw SQL Queries  
• CLI Interface

4. System Features
• Add Expense  
• Update Expense  
• Delete Expense  
• Search by Date  
• Category Analytics  
• Monthly Budget Alert  
• Persistent Storage

5. Database Design

Tables:
1. categories(id, name)  
2. expenses(id, title, amount, date, category_id)  
3. subscriptions(id, name, amount, next_date)  
4. budgets(id, month, limit)

Relationships:
Category 1 ---- N Expenses

6. Modules Description

a) Expense Module
- Add new expense  
- Update existing expense  
- Delete expense  
- ORM based operations

b) Report Module
- Category wise total  
- Aggregation using GROUP BY  
- Raw SQL joins

c) Budget Module
- Set monthly limit  
- Compare with spending  
- Alert when exceeded

d) Search Module
- Find expenses by date using SQL query

7. Sample SQL Used

SELECT c.name, SUM(e.amount)
FROM categories c
JOIN expenses e
ON c.id = e.category_id
GROUP BY c.name;

8. Learning Outcomes
• ORM concepts  
• SQL joins & aggregation  
• Modular programming  
• Exception handling  
• CLI application design

9. Future Enhancements
• CSV Export  
• Flask UI  
• Authentication  
• Charts integration

10. Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical use of Python with databases and SQL. 
It is suitable for resume showcase and interview explanation.




💰 FINTRACK PRO – CLI Finance Manager

FinTrack Pro is a command-line based personal finance management system developed using Python, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy ORM.
The project helps users record daily expenses, organize spending by category, monitor monthly budgets, and generate analytical reports using both ORM-based queries and raw SQL.
It is designed as a learning-focused yet practical project, suitable for academic evaluation, interviews, and resume showcase.

📌 Features

🧱 Database Design
Tables

categories

id (Primary Key)

name (Unique)

expenses

id (Primary Key)

title

amount

date

category_id (Foreign Key)

budgets

id (Primary Key)

month (Unique – YYYY-MM)

limit

Relationships

One-to-Many Relationship

One Category can have multiple Expenses

⚙️ How the Code Works
Database Connection

SQLAlchemy engine connects Python to the SQLite database

declarative_base() is used to define ORM models

sessionmaker() manages database sessions for queries and transactions

ORM Models

Category Model stores expense categories and maintains relationship with expenses

Expense Model stores individual expense records linked to categories

Budget Model stores monthly spending limits

CRUD Operations

Create: Add new categories, expenses, and budgets

Read: Search expenses and generate reports

Update: Modify existing expenses

Delete: Remove expense records

Reports & Analytics

Uses raw SQL queries for aggregation and reporting

Demonstrates JOIN, GROUP BY, and SUM operations

Example:

SELECT c.name, SUM(e.amount)
FROM categories c
JOIN expenses e
ON c.id = e.category_id
GROUP BY c.name;

Budget Monitoring

Monthly expenses are calculated using SQL

Compared against stored budget limits

Displays alerts when spending exceeds the limit

🖥 CLI Menu Options
1. Add category
2. Add expense
3. Update expense
4. Delete expense
5. Search by date
6. Category report
7. Set monthly budget
8. Budget alert
9. Exit
